Q. Evaluate 3 LLMs with their ‘advanced models’ 
→ Which LLM is “best” — explain your logic

Comparing advanced models, I think Claude was the best. Its summaries were pretty detailed. I loved the format of its bullet points method. The TLDR, however, failed to mention the Media coverage deadline and lacked quite a few key metrics or points but captures the importance of this event. It has a pretty detailed executive summary. But, in terms of cost metrics, its very expensive and has been known to be a bit slow.
Objectively, GPT was great, clear and concise answer with no hallucination. Great lengths and it offers a good tradeoff between
consiseness and completeness. (Though, not a personal preference) 



Q. Which LLM is best when using their less expensive model?
The gpt-simple was pretty great. It gave nearly the same useful output as the advanced version, at lower cost. I liked its executive summary the best. Its detailed, but not hallucinated. The redirection to external link for more nasa education resources was a great addition. It was compact, and covered all the key points.


Q. Are the more expensive models much better for this task?

No, not materially. For a short factual summary of a press release, the advanced models add marginal polish at best. In some cases the advanced models actually introduced risky hallucinations or extra invented details. So the incremental benefit is small while the cost is higher.
One practical suggestion could be to use the cheaper models to produce the draft summary, then optionally use the advanced models only to polish language and structure but with careful fact checking.
